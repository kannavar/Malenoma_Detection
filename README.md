## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- Problem Statement 

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

- What is the dataset that is being used?

The dataset provided has around 2300 images with samples from 9 different skin cancer types. This dataset is being used for training the

## Conclusions
- In case of class imbalance of the dataset , there are very high changes that the model would either overfit or underfit 
- Data Augmentation is a technique used to generate more samples from teh current minimal dataset by applying the Rotation , Flip ,Zoom or flip vertical or horizontal augmentation techniques to bloat the training dataset.
- Reducing the disparity in the distribution of the different Class images , will significantly improve the model accuracy.
